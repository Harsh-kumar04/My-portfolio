# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio website where I showcase my technical skills and projects. It is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The backbone of the website structure.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including using W3.CSS for utility-based styling.
- **JavaScript**: For added functionality such as opening links in new tabs.
- **Font Awesome**: For incorporating scalable vector icons.
- **W3.CSS**: A CSS framework used for easy styling and layout management.

Feel free to check out the source code and see my skills and projects!
